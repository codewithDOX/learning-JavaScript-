 //=======//ECMA//==========//

 // ECMA script is an international organization for Javascript who sets standards for the language so you can visit there webiste --   https://tc39.es  and read documentation although recommended for extreme professionals so it's better to prefer MDN references //

"use strict"; // treat all JS code as newer version

// alert( 3 + 3 ) // we are using node.js, not browser

//  console.log( 3 + 3 ); console.log("Ron")// DO not write the code in this manner it destroys the readability , documentation and representation of your code though it will still run // 


//You can excute this even without a semicolon but it's a good practice , And use an extension called prettier to make your code much more readable// 

console.log( 3 + 3 )
console.log("Ron")
